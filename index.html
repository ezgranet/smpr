<p class="first">This system is majorly indebted to the work of Sean Graham
(University of Alberta), whose design of Dual Member Proportional
Representation (DMP) provided an excellent system of proportional
representation in the Canadian
context.<input id="fn-2" type="checkbox"><label for="fn-2">2</label><small>&ensp;<span
id="fn-2-content">Principally, the context that Canada is very very big,
and almost entirely empty except where it’s not.</span></small> I have
no doubt that his system is better suited than mine for the unique
geographic and political context of Canada. I have attempted, as best I
can, to design a system best fitted to the unique political and
geographic context of the United Kingdom, and in doing so, have borrowed
many of the brilliantly innovative elements of Graham’s DMP system.</p>
<h1 id="prior-assumptions">Prior Assumptions </h1>
<p class="backtoc"><small><a href="#TOC">back to TOC</a></small>
</p>
<p>The question of the ‘best’ electoral system is meaningless; each
electoral system prioritises different values and outcomes. Furthermore,
because the system changes both voting and campaigning behaviour, it is
impossible to compare systems in the abstract. The complex interplay of
value-judgments and outcomes was neatly summed up by UCL’s esteemed Dr
Alan Renwick, who has said ‘I’ve published several books on electoral
systems and every time I research electoral systems more, I get even
less clear on which electoral system I think is
best.’<input id="fn-3" type="checkbox"><label for="fn-3">3</label><small>&ensp;<span
id="fn-3-content">The remarks can be heard at <a
href="https://youtu.be/-r2XlSTyxsQ?t=3763"
class="uri">https://youtu.be/-r2XlSTyxsQ?t=3763</a>.</span></small>
There can never be a universalist argument for a single, optimal system.
Instead, the choice is about which electoral system best balances
competing priorities in the specific national (or regional, etc)
political and social context.</p>
<p>The single-member majoritarian system—often referred to as
first-past-the-post, or FPTP—used for Westminster elections in the UK
is, by definition, not concerned with a proportional outcome, but
instead with the outcome of 650 entirely separate contests. Many, myself
included, believe that the electoral system ought to be reformed to
include proportional or semi-proportional representation in some form.
This view is, of course, of a very longstanding one, and many, many
electoral systems have been proposed for adding a proportional element
to Westminster elections. These systems, ranging from the many
permutations of the single-transferrable vote (STV) to the Jenkins
Commission’s alternative vote plus (AV+), have one thing in common: they
were not implemented.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important lesson comes from the 2010 referendum on
the introduction of the alternative vote (AV). AV is not a proportional
system; the hope of the Liberal Democrats, who have long championed the
introduction of STV, was that AV would be the first, easier step to
introducing STV. The second, more difficult step would be increasing the
district magnitude by merging constituencies. Yet, this first, facile
step was too much change and uncertainty for the UK electorate, who
resoundingly rejected the change. There were many reasons for the
rejection, including the unpopularity of the spokespeople, status quo
bias, and general lack of public interest, but, regardless, the result
was a loud and intense rejection of a relatively minor change to the
system.<span class="citation" data-cites="whiteley2011"></span></p>
<p>My primary aim in constructing this system was to learn the lesson of
this referendum—<em>viz</em>, that even seemingly minor changes (like
introducing numbers to ballot papers) can render a voting system
dead-on-arrival. Therefore, to maximise the chances of this system
overcoming the considerable hurdles and opposition to reform (amongst
both the electorate and institutional actors such as political parties)
by, wherever possible, minimising all forms of change. The goal was to
create a system which resembled FPTP to the greatest possible extent
(and enjoyed its many advantages), while also introducing
proportionality to the system. I sought to avoid change in every aspect
of the system, from preserving parliamentary procedure (by ensuring that
each member could be referred to by their constituency designation) to
avoiding altering the ballot.</p>
<p>The result was the system enumerated below, which can achieve a
largely proportional outcome while retaining as a defining feature small
single-member electoral districts. The primary focus of this project was
to draft an electoral system minimising, wherever possible, change to
the existing system. However, it is a happy coincidence that the outcome
(I hope) resembles the so-called ‘sweet spot’ identified by Carey and
Hix of low-magnitude proportional representation.<span class="citation"
data-cites="careyhix2011"></span>. Nonetheless, there are manifestly
much much better better designed systems; the goal of this project is
not to design a better than those already created, not least because I
would clearly fail miserably at trying to outdo the brilliant minds
behind existing systems. Instead, it was to create a proportional system
with the highest possible chance of one day being enacted in the UK
(which is still very very low).</p>

<h2 id="constituencies">Constituencies </h2>
<ol>
<li><p>All MPs are elected from Single Member Constituencies (SMCs). No
constituency has more than one MP. Every part of the UK is
simultaneously in two overlapping single member constituencies.</p></li>
<li><p>These are divided into two sets: the plurality constituencies and
the proportional constituencies.</p></li>
<li><p>A proportional constituency’s is entirely coterminous with the
territory of on average, 4 adjacent plurality constituencies. However,
given the variance in constituency population size, some proportional
constituencies will encompass more than 4 plurality constituencies and
some will encompass less.</p></li>
<li><p>In a general election, an elector casts their vote simultaneously
for their plurality and their proportional MP, by checking a box
adjacent to the names of the candidate(s) for both seats. An entirely
independent candidate may only run for a plurality constituency seat,
although a micro-party with two candidates can stand for both a
proportional and plurality seat (even if it would stand little chance of
receiving enough votes to earn a proportional seat).</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-plurality-seats">The Plurality Seats</h2>
<p class="backtoc"><small><a href="#TOC">back to TOC</a></small>
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In each plurality constituency, the candidate with the most votes
is declared the duly-elected MP for that constituency.</p></li>
<li><p>A party must win at least <strong>one</strong> plurality seat to
be eligible for a proportional seat. Any party which fails to win a
single plurality seat is thus excluded from Parliament (as is currently
the case under FPTP); this functions as an electoral threshold.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-proportional-seats">The Proportional Seats </h2>
<p class="backtoc"><small><a href="#TOC">back to TOC</a></small>
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The 130 proportional seats are then allocated on a national
basis. The seats are awarded sequentially taking into account the seats
already won (either plurality or proportional), by calculating over 130
iterative rounds the St Laguë quota of <span
class="math inline">$\frac{V}{2S+1}$</span>, where <span
class="math inline"><em>V</em></span> is total votes for the party, and
<span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> is total seats. In each
round,the party with the highest quota is awarded a proportional
seat.</p></li>
<li><p>When a party is awarded a proportional seat, the available (ie
not yet elected) proportionality constituency candidate for that party
with the most votes is elected as the MP for the constituency in which
he or she stood.</p></li>
<li><p>There are no overhang or compensatory seats. Once 130 seats have
been allocated, the process is completed.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no additional electoral deposit required for a
proportional seat candidate provided the party has paid the deposit for
at least one plurality seat candidate in a plurality seat located within
the proportional seat.</p></li>
<li><p>Provided a party puts forward <em>both</em> at least one
plurality candidate and a proportionality candidate for any overlapping
set of seats, its proportionality candidate will appear on the ballot of
all voters within that prpoortional seat. This means that some (but not
all) voters in a given proportional seat will see <em>just</em> a
party’s proportional candidate on their ballot. They may elect to vote
for that candidate, in which case their votes will count towards the
party’s total and the candidate’s internal ranking. This allows smaller
parties, who for logistical or financial reasons cannot stand the full
complement of candidates, to still be eligible to receive
proportionality seats.</p></li>
<li><p>Any parties or independent candidates which do not stand against
each other in any plurality or proportionality constituency may combine
to form a single electoral unit for the purposes of calculating
entitlements for proportionality seats. For example, the English &amp;
Welsh Greens and the Scottish Greens, which are separate parties, could
combine their vote totals so as to be counted as a single party when
calculating proportional entitlements. Equally, pacts between
independents and parties (such as that between Dominic Grieve and the
Liberal Democrats in 2019) could lead to similar arrangements, with Mr
Grieve’s votes counting towards the Liberal Democrat total. This will
encourage co-operation without forcing the ideologically uncomfortable
party mergers required by FPTP.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="advantages">Advantages </h1>
<p class="backtoc"><small><a href="#TOC">back to TOC</a></small>
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Minimal change to existing system or ballot; eliminating concerns
raised by AV referendum.</p></li>
<li><p>Retains the central link between MP and constituents</p></li>
<li><p>Promotes strong regional identities by empowering MPs to speak
for a region at large.</p></li>
<li><p>Transparency: no opaque party lists. Candidates are only elected
MPs of places where they appeared on the ballot (and one presumes,
campaigned).</p></li>
<li><p>Direct link between votes for a proportionality candidate and
their chances of being elected (because the vote puts them higher up the
internal party list for the allocation of seats).</p></li>
<li><p>Avoiding multi-member districts allows the tradition of referring
to members by their constituency (‘the Hon Member for South
Cambridgeshire’), and prevents the need for a change to parliamentary
procedure.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoids ‘two classes of MP’; all MPs have a specific constituency
to whom they are responsible.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoids extremist parties being represented by retaining the
current, extremely powerful threshold of having to win a plurality SMC
to gain representation in Parliament. There is absolutely no possiblity
of the disgraceful result produced by the party list system in the 2004
EU elections, which resulted in the

id="fn-4-content">The ‘N’ technically does not, in the most pedantic
sense, literally stand for ‘Nazi’, but it basically does</span></small>P
being represented in the European Parliament.</p></li>
<li><p>Using a national, as opposed to regional, proportional allocation
of seats allows for the a high degree of proportionality with a
relatively small ratio of plurality to proportionality MPs.</p></li>
<li><p>The St Laguë quota ensures that small parties benefit.</p></li>
<li><p>Yet always close link between proportional candidates and
constituency</p></li>
<li><p>Ends the effective disenfranchisement of people in the Speaker’s
constituency.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoids the inequality of advocates: everyone (with the minor
exception of the Speaker’s constituency) has the same number of
advocates in Parliament.</p></li>
<li><p>Allows for more equal rates of representation while retaining
geographically determined constituencies: the extremes of Na h-Eileanan
an Iar and the Isle of Wight can be balanced out by varying the size of
proportionality seats.</p></li>
<li><p>Ends wasted votes by ensuring that even votes for hopeless
candidates in safe seats can both boost the candidates’ party’s fortunes
in the national proportional allocation and the chances of obtaining a
proportional member from that list.</p></li>
<li><p>Allows for productive co-operation between parties.</p></li>

<h1 id="potential-problems">Potential problems </h1>
<p class="backtoc"><small><a href="#TOC">back to TOC</a></small>
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>This does nothing to resolve the very silly situation of the
Speaker’s constituents being disenfranchised, although it does at least
ameliorate it by giving them an actively political MP (albeit one they
had no say in choosing). It is clearly preferrable that the UK adopts
the system used in Ireland, where the outgoing Ceann
Comhairle<input id="fn-5" type="checkbox"><label for="fn-5">5</label><small>&ensp;<span
id="fn-5-content">Think a speaker, but IRISH</span></small> is
auotmatically returned to the
Dáil<input id="fn-6" type="checkbox"><label for="fn-6">6</label><small>&ensp;<span
id="fn-6-content">Think the first chamber of a legislature, but
IRISH</span></small> as an additional TD.<input id="fn-7" type="checkbox"><label for="fn-7">7</label><small>&ensp;<span
id="fn-7-content">Think an MP, but IRISH</span></small> My preferred
solution would to be create a bespoke Parliamentary constituency
encompassing only the House of Commons chamber, whose MP is the Speaker.
However, it is already difficult
enough<input id="fn-8" type="checkbox"><label for="fn-8">8</label><small>&ensp;<span
id="fn-8-content">Read: virtually impossible</span></small> to change
the electoral system; it seemed excessive to try to fix the speakership
too in one go.</p></li>
<li><p>Theoretically, if a party which only contests elections in one
constituent part of the UK was virtually shut out of plurality seats, it
could ‘run out’ of proportionality seat candidates. For example (and
this is very much not the case at present), if the SNP were to get 30%
of the vote in Scotland, but (due to intense competition from Labour,
the Conservatives, and the Liberal Democrats) not win a single
MP,<input id="fn-9" type="checkbox"><label for="fn-9">9</label><small>&ensp;<span
id="fn-9-content">This, obviously, is the sort of electoral scenario
that is theoretically imaginable, but incredibly, incredibly unlikely to
ever happen in reality</span></small> it might be entitled to more
proportionality seats than exist in Scotland. If, before an election,
the SNP feared such an outcome, they might take the step of
pre-emptively standing paper candidates in English plurality and
proportionality seats in order to provide a buffer. This would be highly
undesirable for two reasons: first, the SNP would strongly object to
standing in England, and second, English voters might feel that their
interests were not best represented by a proportionality MP from a party
expressly uninterested in the governance of England. However, this sort
of electoral scenario is extremely unlikely except as a thought
experiment, because of the reality of Westminster elections. If it were
to appear
likely,<input id="fn-10" type="checkbox"><label for="fn-10">10</label><small>&ensp;<span
id="fn-10-content">It almost certainly won’t</span></small> the obvious
and amenable solution would be for Plaid Cymru and the SNP to stand as a
single party for the purposes of proportionality seats (after all, the
two do not stand candidates against each other and have a warm working
relationship).</p></li>
<li><p>Theoretically, it is possible with a candidate with relatively
little initial support in a local area to be elected a representative.
For example, the Greens may, in the majority of constituencies in which
they stand (<em>pace</em> Brighton Pavilion), which may lead to a
relatively high number of aggregated votes but relatively few highly
placed candidates. The result is a proportionality candidate for the
Greens may be high up the party list with ‘only’ 10,000
votes.<input id="fn-11" type="checkbox"><label for="fn-11">11</label><small>&ensp;<span
id="fn-11-content">This is a made-up number</span></small> This occurs
in other systems, such as under STV (see eg Australian Senate
elections), and, realistically, any proportional system results in
people having at least <em>a</em> representative for whom not many of
them voted.</p></li>

<p>The Cornwall constituency is a paradigmatic example of how SMPR’s
proportional seats can be foster regional identity. By giving often
neglected regions, such as Cornwall, a distinct voice in Parliament, it
can help remedy regional inequalities. Additionally, the local roots of
SMPR enusre the system can connect with everyday voters. Most people in
Britain have lives, and therefore have never heard of the St Laguë
formula, but everyone can understand the concept of an MP for
Cornwall.</p>
<p>Three of the parties have stood candidates in both constituencies.
The Green Party, however, has not stood a candidate in St Ives. This
could be, for example, because of the difficulty in finding a good PPC,
the lack of party organisation in the constituency, or the likelihood of
losing the
deposit.<input id="fn-12" type="checkbox"><label for="fn-12">12</label><small>&ensp;<span
id="fn-12-content">Obviously these are generic fictional reasons which
have nothing whatsoever to do with the actual St Ives Greens, who I am
sure are lovely.</span></small>. However, because the Greens have stood
at least one candidate in one of the other plurality constituencies in
Cornwall, they are entitled to stand a candidate for the proportional
seat. It then follows logically that this candidate will appear on the
ballot of all voters in the constituency, regardless of which plurality
seat they overlap with.</p>
<p>There is also an independent candidate, who is standing only in St
Ives. As in FPTP, independent candidates are welcome to stand in any
plurality seat. While independent candidates cannot by themselves stand
in both proportional and plurality seats, because <span
class="math inline">1 &lt; 2</span>, groups of independents may band
together to form new, small parties in their region or on the basis of a
shared ideology.</p>

<h2 id="a-vociferous-health-warning">A vociferous health warning! </h2>
<p>The data used in the thought experiment below are largely based on
the 2019 general election. However, this is emphatically
<strong>not</strong> a counterfactual simulation, nor even a rough guess
of what the results of the 2019 election would have been under SMPR. As
noted before (but it bears strenuous repeating), the system is not a
neutral variable that can be changed while leaving everything else the
same. There is no <em>ceteris paribus</em> with electoral systems,
because the system shapes the entire election. UK voters are incredibly
accustomed to the FPTP system, and voting choices under the system are
shaped by it.<span class="citation" data-cites="kiewet2013"></span>.
That’s before even considering how alterations to electoral law and
constituency boundaries might shape inter- or intra-party competition;
furthermore, the changed electoral realities of a different system might
have dissuaded various parties from even supporting an election in 2019
in the first place.</p>
<p>The maths below are just a way to see the output SMPR would produce
on a relatively plausible input. They have no predictive value. They
have no counterfactual value. Instead, their value is in demonstrating
how the proportional features of SMPR intervene to alter parliamentary
composition following (an entirely fictional, but not unrealistic)
single-member constituency result. In that sense, this section is
useful; it ought not to be mis-used.</p>

<p class="backtoc"><small><a href="#TOC">back to TOC</a></small>
</p>

<p>There are 520 plurality seats, which we can assume have been
carefully and correctly apportioned by the four Boundary Commissions.
Although it is unclear how voter behaviour might be altered by the
knowledge that votes for poorly placed local candidates are no longer
‘wasted’, let us
imagine<input id="fn-13" type="checkbox"><label for="fn-13">13</label><small>&ensp;<span
id="fn-13-content">Read: I cannot be bothered to make up new
numbers</span></small> a world where the results broadly resemble
2019’s. Using the 2019 election data,<span class="citation"

<span class="tt">mmp-calc</span><input id="fn-14" type="checkbox"><label for="fn-14">14</label><small>&ensp;<span
id="fn-14-content"><a href="github.com/ezgranet/mmp-calc">Available at this link.</a></span></small>, I proportionally
distributed (using the St Laguë quota) the seats won at the 2019
election (650 plurality seats) into a 520 plurality seat Parliament,
making for arbitrary reasons and without any evidence the wildly
inaccurate assumption that the plurality seat distribution would be
proportionally the same under
SMPR.<input id="fn-15" type="checkbox"><label for="fn-15">15</label><small>&ensp;<span
id="fn-15-content">I really want to emphasise that this assumption is
just for illlustration, and absolutely <strong>not</strong> how a real

assigned the Speaker’s seat to Labour when tallying up the 650
distributions, as it was a Labour safe
seat.<input id="fn-16" type="checkbox"><label for="fn-16">16</label><small>&ensp;<span
id="fn-16-content">Also this is already such an arbitrary exercise that
one more arbitrary choice can’t hurt.</span></small>. The results are

<h2 id="assessing-the-outcome">Assessing the Outcome </h2>
<p class="backtoc"><small><a href="#TOC">back to TOC</a></small>
</p>

<p>At the outset, I established the criterion by which this system was
to primarily be judged: can it maximise its proportionality while
minimising change to FPTP, and thus increase the chance of eventual
adoption?</p>
<p>The minimal change involved in SMPR shows it meets the first
criterion perhaps as well as any system which is not literally FPTP
could. There are no pesky numbers or panachage ballots here. The task
now, therefore, is to see how proportional this entirely imaginary and
unrealistic outcome is.</p>
<p>The standard
way<input id="fn-18" type="checkbox"><label for="fn-18">18</label><small>&ensp;<span
id="fn-18-content">Sorry, Loosemore-Hanby.</span></small> of measuring
disproportionality is through the least-squares index developed by
Gallagher.<span class="citation" data-cites="gallagher1991"></span> As
its name implies, the index is calculated using the formula below:</p>
<div class="center">
<p><span class="math display">$$I=\frac{\displaystyle\sum^{n}_{i=1} (s_i
-v_i)^2 }{2}$$</span> <span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
	\textrm{Where}&amp;&amp;\\
	s&amp;=&amp;\textrm{The number of seats for a given party}\\
	v &amp;=&amp;\textrm{The number of votes for a given party}\\
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
</div>
<p>The table below indicates that SMPR is noticeably more proportional
in these measures, with most parties gaining reasonable approximations
of their vote share. I repeat the strenuous, emphatic <strong>Health
Warning</strong> given above: this is not what a ‘typical’ election
under SMPR would give, and it is not a model of future or past
elections. It is simply a good indicator that SMPR can produce quite
proportional outcomes <a href="http://christophergandrud.github.io/Disproportionality_Data/">(in this case, ones which are equal or better to many countries with proportional representation).</a></p>
